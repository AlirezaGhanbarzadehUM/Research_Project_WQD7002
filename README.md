# Research_Project_WQD7002
This repository includes Python codes related to Data Science Research Project (WQD7002)
The aim of this project is to measure the prediction performace of LSTM and stacked LSTM models
and to compare it with traditional staticial time series predcitn models such as ARIMA.
